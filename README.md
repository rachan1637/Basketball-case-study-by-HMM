# Basketball-case-study-by-HMM

The goal of the case study is to use HMM for modelling basketball data and provide useful insights, advised by Professor Vianey Leos Barajas.

The textbook we use is "Hidden Markov Models for Time Series: An Introduction Using R".

## Ongoing Progress 
End up reading the textbook chapter 1-5, and make notes for summarizing the key points in the textbook.
