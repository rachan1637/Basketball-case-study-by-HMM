# Basketball-case-study-by-HMM

The goal of the case study is to use HMM for modelling basketball data and provide useful insights, advised by Professor Vianey Leos Barajas.

The textbook we use is "Hidden Markov Models for Time Series: An Introduction Using R".

## Ongoing Progress 

Writing codes for simulating a simple basketball game (leading or falling behind, and what are the strategies under these cases) by HMM.

The codes are written in R and R Studio [Simple Basketball Game Simulation by HMM](https://github.com/rachan1637/Basketball-case-study-by-HMM/blob/main/Practice%20Code/Simulating-HMM-basketball.Rmd), and the report can be found [here](https://github.com/rachan1637/Basketball-case-study-by-HMM/blob/main/Practice%20Code/Simulating-HMM-basketball.pdf)

## Completed Progress

### June 9th
End up reading the textbook chapter 1-5, and make notes for summarizing the key points in the textbook.  

The notes can be found in [HMM Notes](https://github.com/rachan1637/Basketball-case-study-by-HMM/tree/main/HMM%20Notes).
