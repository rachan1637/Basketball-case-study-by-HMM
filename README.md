# Detecting Basketball Events by HMM

The goal of the case study is to use HMM for modelling basketball data and provide useful insights, advised by Professor Vianey Leos Barajas.

The textbook we use is "Hidden Markov Models for Time Series: An Introduction Using R".

## Ongoing Progress 

Identify the 3pt shooting together with long pass. Consider the dribble, and other complex basketball events.

## Completed Progress

### June-July

(a) Idetify the long pass and 3pt shooting.

The preprocessing codes are written in python ([preprocess data](https://github.com/rachan1637/Basketball-case-study-by-HMM/tree/main/Basketball/data_preprocess)).

The analysis part are written in R and R Studio, the pdf file is here: [Identify long pass and 3pt shooting](https://github.com/rachan1637/Basketball-case-study-by-HMM/blob/main/Basketball/basketball2.pdf).

Two gifs are made for the identification respectively, [pass](https://github.com/rachan1637/Basketball-case-study-by-HMM/blob/main/Basketball/event1_passing.gif) and [3pt shooting](https://github.com/rachan1637/Basketball-case-study-by-HMM/blob/main/Basketball/event28_3pt.gif).

(b) Identify the layup following other's case.

The codes are written in R and R Studio, the pdf file is in the same location: [Identify the Layup by HMM](https://github.com/rachan1637/Basketball-case-study-by-HMM/blob/main/Basketball/basketball.pdf).

(c) Writing codes for simulating a simple basketball game (leading or falling behind, and what are the strategies under these cases) by HMM.

The codes are written in R and R Studio [Simple Basketball Game Simulation by HMM](https://github.com/rachan1637/Basketball-case-study-by-HMM/blob/main/Practice%20Code/Simulating-HMM-basketball.Rmd), and the report can be found [here](https://github.com/rachan1637/Basketball-case-study-by-HMM/blob/main/Practice%20Code/Simulating-HMM-basketball.pdf).

### June 9th
End up reading the textbook chapter 1-5, and make notes for summarizing the key points in the textbook.  

The notes can be found in [HMM Notes](https://github.com/rachan1637/Basketball-case-study-by-HMM/tree/main/HMM%20Notes).
